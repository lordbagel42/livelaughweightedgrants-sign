## 10/30/2025 - Found a font, wood needed, and made a rough OnShape setup.

There is much to be done still, but this is overall a decent spot. Mostly just figuring out what I want this thing to look like and designing so I can actually manufacture it with my CNC and my capabilities. Simple project, but I want to share this lol. Turns out fonts that work well with CNC are a pain to find, so this is a multiple day project.

  

## 10/31/2025 - Started cutting the baseplate!  

Long story short, I got mad at Inkscape and Fusion after spending way, way too much time making the measurements for my text work. It's almost done, actually. I figured out I have to change one of my dimensions to make this actually yknow, physically possible to make, but overall it's good.
